## Quick Setup
__Requirements__
- Java JDK11 
- Maven (for building the project)
- (Optional for VM). Mongo DB requires a CPU with AVX support. You may run into this issue if using [Oracle Virtual](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/could-not-start-mongodb-5-0-running-oracle-linux-on-virtualbox/120524/10) Box or [Kubernetes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70818543/mongo-db-deployment-not-working-in-kubernetes-because-processor-doesnt-have-avx)

Run the following commands to build the war file and deploy it to the docker container. 
```
git clone git@github.com:factionsecurity/faction.git
cd faction
docker-compose up --build
```

Once the containers are up you can navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080 to access your FACTION instance. 
On the first boot, it will ask you to create an admin account. 

## Import the Vulnerability Templates

# 1.2 Release Updates

Faction 1.2 introduces the App Store! The Faction App Store will make it easier for developers to extend faction. Faction Extensions can be used to trigger custom code when certain events happen in your workflow like sending all vulnerbilities to Jira when the assessment is complete or update a tracking system when retests pass or fail. More information can be found in the [documentation site](https://docs.factionsecurity.com). 

### ⭐️ Jira Integration and AppStore Dashboard

Note you can reorder extensions so that updates for one can affect updates to the next. 

### ⭐️ Extensions for Custom Graphics
Extensions will also allow custom bar charts to your reports:
