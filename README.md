## Quick Setup
__Requirements__
- Java JDK11 
- Maven (for building the project)
- (Optional for VM). Mongo DB requires a CPU with AVX support. You may run into this issue if using [Oracle Virtual](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/could-not-start-mongodb-5-0-running-oracle-linux-on-virtualbox/120524/10) Box or [Kubernetes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70818543/mongo-db-deployment-not-working-in-kubernetes-because-processor-doesnt-have-avx)

Run the following commands to build the war file and deploy it to the docker container. 
```
git clone git@github.com:factionsecurity/faction.git
cd faction
docker-compose up --build
```

Once the containers are up you can navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080 to access your FACTION instance. 
On the first boot, it will ask you to create an admin account.
